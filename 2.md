# Day 2

## Summary

* ~30 minute discussion of what youâ€™ve been working on and talking about
* ~30 minute discussion/workshop on charters
rest of the time left to you all to work together with or without some of us in the room

## Part 1
* What worked?
* What did not?
* Did they use those questions that I put out there? What was good about them? What not?
Describe the document they put together.

Re: the library project - for this particular document I would bracket the particulars of the project you've suggested. What is the broader interest? How can you connect this library interest with the resources and aims of the lab?

What are your research interests for the project?

* More ways for others to learn from you than just this.
* Tools aren't the only things applicable to other contexts - by thoroughly documenting the process, the workflows, the aims, etc. people get a lot out of the example. Think about the public-facing aspect as an intervention. Could give people a toolkit to implement what you're designing.


* Charters aren't about specific products per se -
* They're about values - individual and group. A place to reflect on the outcomes but also the process.
* credit? communication? presentation or publication? Equal credit? Conflict management? Are you aiming to build a thing that will need to be maintained? Who will do it? What kinds of licensing will you care about? How will you engage the public throughout the process?

* What values have emerged out of conversations this past week?
* What do you want to get out of the fellowship on a personal level?
* How can you act on them in concrete ways throughout the process? How can you phrase these as commitments to one another?

In practical terms:
* What are your big goals? What about for yourselves? Are you sure?
* What needs to happen for them to take place? Practicalities but also short-term goals.

## Looking forward to next time:
* Read the other charters, especially the Scholar's Lab charter. Explicitly articulate and use those things that you care about. This is about explicitly articulating the implicit. What are your responsibilities to each other? What will your commitment.
* Iterate over project ideas - don't be wedded to the first thing you propose.
Come up with five more. No need to choose at this early stage. Imagine it as though you're circling the drain. Getting closer each time to something that works. We just need enough. longer-term.
* Do an environmental scan - look at some things that are already out there. Each take a project or two that interest you and report back to the group about what it is that interests you about it. SLab staff can help point you to things. Don't want to be limited by not knowing what you don't know. We'll start introducing some techniques and technologies you can use.
