# Part One - What We Talk about When We Talk about Digital Humanities

Aim is just to introduce them to the lab staff and get them comfortable talking in the space

* Introduce each other - students first and then lab
* Why are they here? What brought them here?
* What is digital humanities for each of us? What was our own particular path into it
* Introduce plan for the year
* Introduce logistics for the program - ten hours a week.
* blogging
* Has everyone gotten paid?
* Critical making
* Float idea of the makerspace as a component in that work

# Evaluating Digital Work
Evaluating Digital Work, by which I mean we show some projects that are meaningful to us as provocative examples of DH and offer them some ways to think about them as digital projects. Just introducing broad topics for the conversations that we'll have later in the year.
Ie - credit, makeup, research questions, team makeup, etc. etc.

# Looking to Next Time
Spend some time getting to know each other. Try to answer the following questions for each other as individuals but also try to find common things for the group.
* What do you have in common? From a personal, hobby standpoint but also from a research standpoint.
* What do you care about?
* What values do you share?
* What are you interested in learning?
* What can you do?
* What are you afraid of?
* What scares you?
* What has characterized successful collaborations for you?
* What are the most important things to you right now? By the end of the year?
* Write that stuff down.
