## Structure

* 1 hour of talking about things
* 1 hour of command line by way of Ammon

* General updates on the week? any logistics?

### First - Charter -

* Is the charter finalized?
* Lingering questions? Ready to make it go live?
* I’ll push it up to praxis.scholarslab.org
* Anyone want to blog about it? VOLUNTEER?? (someone that hasn't blogged yet)
* Reflect a little bit on the writing process and the collaborative process so far.
* What has worked? What has not?
* They'll be doing a lot of reflecting over the course of the year

### Brainstorm Project Ideas
* Where is their project at?
* What is new in their thinking?  What about the library?
* Challenge them to think more about the kinds of things that they could do with it.  Do a design jam for their project?

### Framing questions
* What is the problem they are trying to address? What are their research questions?
* Who is their audience?
* What are particular complications?
* What do you like about the ideas that you have so far?
* What are immediate forms of research they could do to help think further?

* what do they imagine libraries are? What parts of libraries are they asking people to engage with? what is digital humanities doing in them?
* How are they trying to get people to engage with them?
* What are alternative ways you can imagine this going?
* What are the limitations for your thinking right now? What would help learn more?

Last moments - Introduce Miriam Posner’s how did they make that?


### For next week
They also start engaging their community - each of you has a librarian tasked with working with their department. Meet them! Talk to them about their work. Maybe come up with a series of interview questions that you’ll all use to get a sense of what kinds of work they do, what they’re interested in, how your project could intersect with them.

For next week, they each take a project
